	 * Set log message verbosity.

	 *  choose to increase the message verbosity level, ensure that your application does not close 
	 *  the stdout/stderr file descriptors.<br>
	 * You are advised to use level LIBUSB_LOG_LEVEL_WARNING. libusb is conservative with its message 
	 * logging and most of the time, will only log messages that explain error conditions and other 
	 * oddities. This will help you debug your software.<br>
	 * If the LIBUSB_DEBUG environment variable was set when libusb was initialized, this function 
	 * does nothing: the message verbosity is fixed to the value in the environment variable.<br>
	 * If libusb was compiled without any message logging, this function does nothing: you'll never
	 * get any messages.<br>
	 * If libusb was compiled with verbose debug message logging, this function does nothing: you'll 
	 * always get messages from all levels.<br>
	 *

	 * 			the context to operate on, or NULL for the default context
	 * @param level
